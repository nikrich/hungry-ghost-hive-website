# Hungry Ghost Hive — Website

A public website for Hungry Ghost Hive. This repository is currently initialized with a README and will be updated as the implementation lands.

## Goals
- Marketing/landing pages
- Documentation hub
- Links to apps and status pages

## Getting started
Once the stack is chosen and code is added, this section will outline how to run the site locally and deploy it. Common patterns we may use:
- Node.js + framework (e.g., Next.js, Astro, Remix)
- Static hosting via a CDN (e.g., Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare)

## Contributing
